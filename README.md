# L2TP/OpenVPN Server with Xray + Rathole + tun2socks Tunnel
# RTX-VPN = (Rathole-tun2socks-Xray) VPN

## What Does this script do?
This script provides a solution for setting up and tunneling L2TP/OpenVPN in restricted locations (e.g., Iran, China).

It aims to tunnel traffic via Xray-core in reverse mode (rathole), making the tunnel traffic appear legitimate.S

## How does it work?
We need two servers: one for incoming L2TP/OpenVPN connections and the other as the endpoint of our connection. The first server (Tunnel Server) will be considered a server with no limit on incoming L2TP/OpenVPN traffic, unlike the Edge Server, which we cannot connect to directly.

The Edge Server establishes the first connection to the Tunnel Server (reverse tunnel) via a VLESS + WebSocket (WS) configuration from Xray-core, exposing a SOCKS5 proxy on the Tunnel Server. We then use tun2socks to route traffic from the SOCKS5 proxy into a virtual interface.

Finally, we use Policy-Based Routing (PBR) to route incoming L2TP/OpenVPN traffic to the tun2socks interface.

## Installation Tutorial

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pouya2000/rtx.git
chmod -R +x RTX-VPN
cd RTX-VPN
./rtxvpn_setup.sh
```
## Manage Users
```bash
./rtxvpn_manage.sh
```
## Supported OS
This script can be run on all Debian-based distributions that use systemd
## Tunnel Tweaking: Xray-core
This script uses 'VLESS + WS' as the default connection for Xray-core. You can configure your desired settings in ```/opt/xray_edge.json``` for the Edge Server and ```/opt/xray_tunnel.json``` for the Tunnel Server
## Tunnel Tweaking: rathole
You can also modify the Rathole configuration in ```/opt/rathole_edge.toml``` for the Edge Server and ```/opt/rathole_tunnel.toml``` for the Tunnel Server."
## Important Note
Please DO NOT modify the vpn server ip pool! But if you did, you MUST change the ip pool inside the ```rtxvpn_setup.sh```
